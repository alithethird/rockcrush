# rockcrush

Time to take back what rockcraft stole from you! 
Unfortunately the current technology doesn't let you time travel so unfortunately we can only take back the storage space :(.

## How to use?

```bash
python3 rockcrush.py
```

## What can it do?

It can find every locally hosted images and remove them. Even if they are currently running in a container, it will remove the container then the image itself.
